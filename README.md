This is a Qt project for development work on the [CavalierContours project](https://github.com/jbuckmccready/CavalierContours). It has an interactive UI app for exploring and testing the algorithm as well as any benchmarks/tests. The project uses a submodule for tracking the main CavalierContours project.
